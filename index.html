            <p>Nature’s beauty has always been an exciting subject. Discover our articles about the beauty of nature examples and prompts to start writing! While watching Our Planet episodes, I can’t help but be surprised at how diverse, and complex nature is. It encompasses the frozen worlds and high seas down to jungles, deserts, and coastal areas. This ambitious documentary is bound to impress every human being by showcasing the natural beauty of planet earth. Humans are closely connected to nature, so everyone can enjoy reading essays about nature. Aside from the many gifts it gives us that are necessary for survival, it also helps us de-stress and reduce anxiety symptoms. When we’re with nature, we feel better emotionally and physically. It’s why we continuously talk about its beauty, whether through poems, songs, or articles.</p>
